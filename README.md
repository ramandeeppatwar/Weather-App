## Client Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Description

My goal with this Web Application was to create a Mobile First seamless weather search for travelers to plan ahead.

- Enter the city of travel in the input field.
- Displayed on the page will be the users searched city name, current date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed and uv index.
- The 5 day forecast for the same search will appear below along with dates, temperatures and humidity.
- Your search is stored to your browser's local storage.
- Each city you search will become a tab at the bottom of the page that you can reference/check back on.
- If you leave the web app and come back, the last city you searched will be displayed.
